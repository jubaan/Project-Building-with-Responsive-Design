# Project-Building-with-Responsive-Design

In this project, we got the chance to build a responsive website. We clone The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. The goal was to set up the layout and use the media queries to mimic The Next Web website.
